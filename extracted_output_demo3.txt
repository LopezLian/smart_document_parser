In cases where the defendant claims a rent-free (Niskar) title the initial

as soon as the plaintiff proves that fact, the burden of proof shifts on the
defendant to show that they arc entitled to hold the land without payment
of rent.

created by the defaulting putnidar or putnidars and unless such encum-
brances were created before the creation of the first putni.

The enuy “ Niskar Bhogdakhal sutre’ in the Record of Rights ac

that the tenanc is not Jiable to pay rent to anybody, and as such this entry,

$. G. Lahiri, J.:—These cleven appeals have been filed by
the tenants defendants under clause 15 of the Letters Patent
against a judgment of Mr. Justice Roxburgh whereby he has
dismissed eleven second appeals preferred by them, questioning
the correciness of decrees, for assessment of rents made by the
Courts below. ,

The plaintiit, Rai Bahadur Phanindra Lal Sen. purchiused
a putni taluk named Lot Simdali at an auction sale held under
the Putoi Regudation on November 17, tggz. This pumi taluk
is included in Touzi No. t of the Burdwan Collectorate, beld
by the Maharaja of Burdwan. J is undisputed that in 1216
B.S. the Maharaja crealed a putni inv respect of the lands of
Mauza Simdali and other properties in favour of one Jagat
Narayan Rov iu i212 BS. One Bhaktaram Roy executed
another Kabuliat inv respect of tands of Mouza Simdali and other
mouvis aud in sz2t B.S. one Bhairah Singh executed a third
putni Kabuliat in respeet of the lands of Mousa Simdali only.
In 1235 BS. the putni was sold under the putni Regulation
and purchased by one Badal Bibi and in ige0 B.S. the putni
Was again sold gud ptrehased by one Bakkeswar whose heirs
were in possession on the date of the auction-sale at which the
plain purchased. The plaintil instiaued che suits out of
which these appeal arise for assessment of rent, alleging that tlie
defendants were tenants under the putni purchased by him, that
the lands hekt by the defendiuits were parts of the imal assets
of ‘Touzi No. 1 of the Burdwan Collectore, that the defendants
were liable to pay reut to the pluinuiffl, but they were refusing
to do so relying upon ceriain incorrect entries in rhe Record of
Riglus which recorded their tenancies as niskar. The suits were
contested by the defendants on the ground that the lands of
their tenancies were not mal lauds, that they had been holding
the lands in lakheraj and niskar rights, that the cniries in the
Record of Rights were correct and that since the defendants
were in possession of the lands without payment of rent, they
were entided to claim a rent free title on the presumption of
lest grant. “The defendants further pleaded that the suits
brought by the plaintiffs were barred by limitation.

Judge and on second appeal by Mr, Justice Roxburgh. In six
out of uhe eleven suits. the interest of the defendants has been
recorded as niskar raivati and in the remaining suits as niskar
n tenure-holders but in all thé cases in the Remarks Column there
> is entry “ Bhogdakhal sutre." The courts below have proceeded
1 08 the footing that in cases of this description the initial onus
is upon the plaintiff to prove that the Jand is a part of his mal
assets and was taken into account at the time of Decennial
J. Setement for the purpose of assessing revenue and as soon as
that is done, the onus shifts on the defendants to prove that
they are entitled to held the land without payment of rent.
It has been found in these cases thac the plainciF has succeeded
in discharging the initial onus. but the defendants have failed
to prove that they are entitled to hold without payment of
rent. Mr, Justice Roxburgh has held that under section 11 of
the Putni Regwation the plaintiff was entitled to get the putni
free from encumbrances created by the defaulling putnidar or
putnidars, and in order to succeed tlie defendants must prove
either that there was a valid or an invalid revenue grant: made
in their favour prior to the permanent settlement or that the
rent free title was created by the Maharaja of Burdwan before
the creation of the first putni in 1zt0 B.S. According to Mr,
Justice Roxburgh the entry in the Record. of Rights at best
proves duu the defendants had niskar tide under one of the
putnidars which was not suflicient to defeat the plaintiff's claim
Against the decision of Mr. Justice Roxburgh the tenants de-
fendants have filed these appeals.

Mr. Ghose appearing in support of the appeals his argued.
in the first plaice, that Mr, Justice Roxburgh hay misunderstood
the effect of the enuy in the Record of Rights. According to
Mr. Ghose the effect of the eniry is that the defendants: must be
taken to have proved that they were uever liable to pav rent
from the inception of the pumi. The putni kabuliyats of veto
BS. ret2 BS. and ret BS. are on the record. The putni
kabuliat of the vear iz2t BS. shows tbat the puimidar was
mitking reservations in respect of a tank for which the aimiindar
had granted sanad and also in respect of rents which had been
realised by the Zamindar up to the date of the execution of the
pumni kabuliat. Vhe putnidar was further stipulating chat he
would not raise any objection with regard to the said grant ar

realisation of rent. If rent free grants had been made by the
zamindar before the creation of the putni as alleged by the
appellants, it js reasonable to expect that the putnidar would
have made similar reservations in respect of those grants but no
such reservation is to be fonnd in the putni kabuliat. From
this fact the inference legitimately follows that rent free grants
were nor made by the zamindar before the creation of the
puuni.

Mr. Ghose next contended that the expression “ niskar
bhogdakhal sutre” in the Record of Rights mearis that the teu-
ants had acquired rent free tite by possession and enjoyment
and there is a presumption of correctness of this entry which
must prevail unless the contrary is proved by the plaintiff.
This interpretation of the entry in the Record of Rights cannot
he accepted as correct. In the case of Kamala Ranjan Roy v.
fran Sheikh (1), © which Mr. Ghose himself drew our attention,
Mitter and Akram JJ. observed as follows at page 16.

“Jf a property is found to be in possession of a man
who is not actually paying rent to anybody the property is to
be described as niskar in the colurhn in which rent is to be
mentioned. If any documents, sanad, chhar etc. be pro-
duced the particulars of the document are to be stated
‘there. But if no sanad. chhar or other documents of that
nature be produced the remark is to be made that it is
“ Bhogdakhal Sutre.”

This passage is based upon an interpretation of Rule No. 97
of the Technicul Rules and Instructions of the Sertlement
Department which the Settlement authorities follow. It follows
from the passage quoted above that the entry “ Niskar Bhog
dakhal Sutre " means that the tenant is not actually paying rent
ta. anybody and not that the tenant is not liable to pay rent to
anyhady. The same view has also been taken by Sen and
Chunder JJ. in the case of Bibhuti Bhusan Kar and ors. vi Rai
Phanindra Lal Sen Bahadur and ors, (2), which has been referred
to by Mr. Justice Roxburgh in his judgment. In this case the
learned Judges held as follows:

“A raiyati interest is assessable to rent and the word
‘niskar’ does nor take away from this linbiliw. Tt only

shows that this raiyati interest had been enjoyed by the
tenants without paying rent. but it does noc show that the
lands are not assessable to rent.”

We see no reason to differ from the observations made in
the two Bench decisions quoted above and. accordingly, we must
hold that the word “niskar” when it appears in the Record
of Rights, by itself does not necessarily mean rent free tenancy,
but only means that the tenant is not in fact paying rent to
anyhody. Mr. Ghose relied upon the decision in the case of
Sri Monohar Das Mahanta v. Charu Ghandra Pal (1), for the
proposition that in that case 2 different view was taken of the
expression “ Bhogdakhil Sutre." On going through that judg
ment. we find nothing which is contrary to the interpretation of
ibat expression as accepted by us.

The next point urged by My. Ghose is chat in cases of the
present description the onus is upon the pkdnull to prove that
the rent free grants came into existence after the creation of
the putni, the presumption being that they “run back toa period
antecedent to the creation of the puti.” In support of this
proposition reliance was placed upon the case of Bipradas Pat
Chowdhury v. Kamini Kumar Lahiri .(2). On going through
the facts of that case, it appears 1 us chat it is af no assistance
to the appellants. That was a case where the plainrif! purchased
x putni taluk ata sale held in execution of rent decree and alter
serving notices under section 167 of the Bengal ‘Tenancy Act
for annulment of encumbrances. sued for eviction of the. deten-
dants as trespassers. The defence infer ala was that uo
zamindar or putnidar was ever in possession within tyelve years
and as such the plaintifls claim was barred by limitation. The
plaintiff, however, relied upon Article 121 of the Limitation Act.
The High Court in its judgment pointed out chat if the plain-
tiff relies wpon Article 191 he has to establish that “the in-
cumbrance which he seeks to annul commenced after the
creation of the Puini * * * * On the other hand, there
is ample evidence that the adverse possession of the defendants
and their predecessors commenced before the creation of the
puini, There are traces on the record to show that there had
been assertions of hostile title before the putni itsell was created.”
Tn these circumstances the Privy Council affirmed the decision

of the High Court upon the view that the proper presumption
was that the adverse possession of the defendants ran back to a
period antecedent to the creation of the putni. In the cases
before us there is nothing to show that the tenants and their pf
predecessors had ever asserted 2 rent free title before the creation |
of the putni, On-the contrary, the putni kabuliyat of
ig21 BS., to which I have already referred, shows that no re '
servation was made in respect of any rent free grant by the
Zamindar. We must, therefore hold that the principle laid down s,
by the Privy Council in Bipradas Pal Chowdhury’s case (1). has
no application to the circumstances of the present case. The
principle of onus applicable to cases of this description has been
setded by a long line of judicial decisions beginning Trom
Hurryhur Mookhopadhya vo Madub) Chunder Baboo (2).
Jagdeo” Narain Singh «. Baldeo Singh (3) and ending
with Kamala Ranjan Roy vy. Iferan Sheikh (4). Ju all these
cases it has been uniformly Jaid down that the intial
onus is upon the pliinu to prove that the lands formed part
of his mal assets and as soon as the plaintiff proves chat fact,
the burden of proof shifts on the defendams to show that they
ure entitled to hold the land without payment of rent. It is
interesting to note that even in Bipradas Pal Chowdhury’s
case (1), the Privy Council expressly follows the principle in
respect of onus laid down in Hurryhur Mookhopadhya’s case (2).
Mr. Ghose made a faint attempt in his opetting to contest the
finding that the lands are’ included in the mal assets of the
plaintiff, but he finally abandoned the point. We must accord-
ingly hold that the pltintiff has discharged the initial burden
that lay upon him to prove that the lands are included in his
mal assets, but ihe defendants have failed co prove that they are
entitled to hold without payment of rent.

In his opening Mr. Ghose raised a point that the suits are
barred under Article 131 of the Second Schedule of the Indian
Limitation Act which provides that in suits to establish 2
periodically recurring right. the limitation is twelve years from
the time when the plaintiff is first refused the enjoyment of the
right. In these cases it has been found by the Courts helow

In view of these findings, Mr. Ghose did nat develop this point

the point about limitation. In these civeumstances. this plea
must be overruled.
