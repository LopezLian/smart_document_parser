Absence of an affidavit of an attesting witness to support a petition for

vided the petition is otherwise in accordance with the provisions of Sections
275-283 of the Indian Succession Act 1925.

Provisions of Scction 68 of the Indian Evidence Act are not exhaustive.
Under the Succession Act and the Rules of this High Court, declaration and
verification of the exccutor and an attesting witness is sufficient proof of the
Will, and the Court has the power to grant probate in non-contentious pro-
ceedings though there be no affidavit from the executor or the attesting
witnesses. : . ;

Proof of non-citation of «a person who ought to have been cited makes
the proceedings defective in substance but it is not in itself sufficient for
summary revocation of the probate granted ex-parte. The Court ought to
give the grantee an opportunity to prove the will in solemn form, and after
hearing evidence and objections, decide whether the order granting probate
should stand or whether it should be revoked. Proof of non-citation thus
converts a non-contentious proceedings into a defended action for proof in
solemn form.

Mere delay and acquiescence under circumstances not amounting to
waiver or estoppel does not bar the right of a person adverscly affected to
apply for revocation of grant of probate in non-contcntious proceedings, and
the onus of establishing such cstoppel or waiver is on the grantee.

-The judgment of the Court was as follows: — *

Bachawat, J.t—This matter raises interesting. questions of
probate practice. This ‘is a petition by Sreemati Sudhalata
Ghose for’revoking the grant of probate of will ‘of her father
Atul Krishna Majumdar and, if necessary, for an order directing
the executors ‘to prove the will in solemn form.

Atul Krishna died on the 12th September, 1947. He left
behind him surviving his. widow Harimati, two daughters,
Sudhalata and Santilata, two grand daughters by a pre-deceased “
son and several grand children by Santilata and a.predeceased
daughter Snehalata.. One Satish Chandra Majumdar, Nirode
Chandra Majumdar, Kanai Lal. Choudhury and Charu Chandra
Choudhury as executors presented to this Court a petition for
grant of probate of the will on the 22nd December, 1947. The
order for grant of probate was made on the 22nd January,1948
wthout issuing any. special citation. Later Satish and Nerode
renounced the executorship. In 1952 Harifati instituted a suit
for administration of the estate of the deceased against Kanai
and Gharu as executors. .

witness (b) the petition did not disclose the names

. _ of the persons upon.whom the estate would have

devolved on intestacy and (c) no special citation

f . _was issued: to the petitioner. .

. (4) If so, is the petitioner . entitled to revocation as a.

‘ matter of course without further investigation?

The petitioner is a childless married daughter of Atul
‘Krishna. It is said that she is barren and, having regard to her

. age, is not likely to have a male issuc. “The evidence establishes
that her husband is willing to adopt a son and is not incapable
of doing so. She, therefore, has the possibility of getting a son
and for purposes of succession ‘to the estate of Atul Krishna
under the Dayabhaga law ranks on the-same footing as Santilata
who is a married daughter having a male issue: Umakanta
Bhattacharjya v. Bed Bati Debi’ (1): In case of intestacy of
of Atul Krishna the petitioner and Santilata are both entitled to

” succeed to his estate after the death of his widow. She is, there-
fore, a presumptive reversioner and as such is entitled to main-
tain this application. , .

. It is contended that the petitioner is set up by Harimati
who having instituted the suit for administration is now debarred
from applying for revocation of the grant. If the petitioner has
an independent right of her own to apply to revocation of the
grant of probate, that right is not lost because she is acting in
concert with some other person or because she has been set up
by the other: Shrooshi.Bala v. Anandamoyee (2). 7

} It is next contended that the petitioner is barred by delay
and acquiescence. The onus of establishing such delay and
‘acquiescence as will bar the petitioner is upon the respondent

_ executors: Shyama Charan Baisya v. Profulla Sundari Gupta (3).
Where the proceedings for grant of probate are contentious, any
person who is cognisant of such proceedings and who chooses
to stand by, allowing others to fight the battle is deemed privy
to the ‘proceedings and is not entitled: to reagitate the matter:

in “Common Form” on-the Tight of the petitidner to put the
executors to proof of the will iri solemn form under the English
practice is thus stated in Tristrain and Coote’s Probate Practice,
(1gth Edition 7. 462):—
“Any party whose interest is adversely affected by .a
probate granted in common form may call it in by citation
and put ‘the party who obtained it, or his representative,
to prove the will in solemn form, and this right is not affect-
ed by mere lapse of time, by acquiescence, or by the receipt
of legacies under the will.” . pe
Mere’ delay and acquiescence under circumstances not
amounting to waiver or estoppel does not bar the right of a
person adversely affected to apply for revocation of’ grant of
probate in non-contentious proceedings: Aswini K. Chakravarty
v. Sukhahavan Chakravarty, (1). Estoppel, or waiver of the
right with full knowledge of material facts must be established.
.In this case waiver and estoppel are not pleaded. It is not.
alleged’ that the petitioner was cognizant of the non-contentious
proceedings during’ the short period, while it was in progress.
It is alleged that the will was read out by one Birendra Nath
Mitra while the applicant was present and that it was then
arranged that the papers would be placed in the hands of a
certain solicitor for taking out probate. - Particulars of the time
and place and of the parties to this arrangement are not
mentioned. No-affidavit from ‘Birendra Nath Mitra has been
produced. There is no distinct averment that the petitioner
knew of the grant after it was made. ,
"In my view the respondents have not established that the
petitioner is debarred from’ making this application for revo-
cation. .- . 2 . .
The next point is whether the proceedings were defective
in substance because .no affidavit from an attesting witness was
filed when the grant for probate was made.. The petition for
grants was in the farm_prescribed by section 276 of the Indian
Succession Act, 1925." It states that.the writing annexed is the
last will- and testament of Atul Krishna and that it was’ duly

Bachawat, J. *I think that the Court. had the power to grant probate on the

oo materials before it. This power is conferred by the Succession

, — Act. Section 275 of the Act says: —
oe - . “The application far probate if made and verified in

' The petition in this case was in proper form and. was made

. + * and verified in the manner provided in the Act. By section 275

. of the Act a petition so made and verified is sufficient authority
, for the grant. It is conclusive for authorizing the grant. - It is
not conclusive for other purposes. But certain statement in the
petition are given special effect for the Section goes on: —
“* * * and no such grant shall be impeached by
reason only that the testator * * * ‘had no fixed place
- of abode or no property within the district at the time of

fraud upon the Court.” me
. +. ‘tees --Phe Court had.the power to call for further proof under

. The Court had jurisdiction to make the grant without calling
. ‘for further proof. Probate was granted under section 289 as it
o, "appeared to the Court that the same should be granted.
The relevant provisions of law are,contained in Sections
- 275, 276,.277, 279, 280, 281, 282, 283 and 289 of the Indian

Neither the Indian succession Act 1865 nor the Probate and
Administration Act 1882 nor the Indian Succession Act 1925
require an affidavit from executor and an atiesting witness before
grant of probate in non-contentious proceedings. They do not
even require the exccutor’s oath. Due execution of the will is
‘proved under these Acts by simple verification and declaration.
Belchambers Rules and Orders 1900 page 3i9: Kinney Probate
and Administration Act, and Edition page ‘110. ——
. Our rules and practicé with regard to proof in non-
contentious grants have varied from time to time. .
~The practices of the Diocese of London. and ecclesiastical
rules were followed in the matter of granting probates by the
Supreme Court in its ecclesiastical jurisdiction under clause 22
of the Supreme Court Charter 14 Geo.-III of 1774.

‘These practices and rules ceased to have effect on the pass-
ing of the Succession Act X of 1865 and in consequence of rule
65 made by this court under the Letters Patent of 1865. But
even thereafter they were to some extent referred to in matters
otherwise unprovided for. — ;

-. Rule 740 of Belchambers Rules and Orders passed under the
Letters Patent of 1865 required an affidavit from an executor in
support of a petition for probate in common form of a written
and perfect will written or subscribed by the testator’s own hand
and such other proof, if any, as. the. court might require.. By
rule 756, the application for probate and swearing in ‘the
executor was done by the same motion. The executor had to
take oath. The corresponding English Practice may be found in

Under our practice apparently the facts not appearing in 7
the defective attestation clause could be supplied by a simple
declaration of the attesting witness: In the Goods of Phul-
kumari Dassi decided by Norris, J. on May 27, 1899 and noted
in Kinney’s Probate & Administration Act, and Edition, page 118.

Prima facie proof of the will was sufficient to warrant the
grant in common form [In Re: Nobodoorga (1)] for persons
interested and adversely affected by the grant had always the
right,to put the executor to proof in solemn form to have the
grant revoked for just cause. .
Rules 740 and 735 are no longer in force. The existing
rules passed in 1914 do not require an oath or affidavit from the
executor. Under rule 33 of Ch. XXXV the English practice
may be followed in matters not provided for by the Succession
Act, the Rules and the Code, so far as applicable and not in*
“consistent with the latter. .

Under the Succession Act and the existing Rules, the de-

' claration and ‘verification of the executor and an attesting wit-
“ness is sufficient proof of thé Will. Following the English prac-
tise and. our previous practice this court has called for further
proof of due execution of the Will where there is no proper
“attestation clause. 7
In the goods of Edwin Carlow Marcelline deceased

for an affidayit from an attesting witness. It docs not
appear that the attestation clause of the Will was defective. _

as evidence until one attesting witness, if procurable,-has been
called for the purpose of proving its execution: ,The Evidence
Act, is not exhaustive. The law of evidence is to be found in
the Evidence Act and ‘in other Acts which make special pro-
visions on ‘matters of evidence: In the matter of Rudolph
Stallmann (1). -In my view sections 275-83 , of the. Suc-
cession Act 1925 contain special provisions for proof
in non-contentious ‘grants. The Evidence Act which is a
general Statute is to be read as silently excluding from its opera-
tion these special provisions. The prima facie proof for grant
in non-contentious case is: furnished by the petition, declaration
and verifications required by Sections 276, 280 and 281 of the
Act. The making of a false statement in the petition and de-
claration: is, by virtue of section ‘28% of the Act, punishable as
‘an offence under section 193 of the Indian Penal Code. Strict
proof of the will, is required in contentious proceedings which,
under section 295 of the Act, takes the form of a regular suit,

In my view, the Court has the power to make the grant in
non-contentious proceedings though-there is no affidavit from the
executor or: the, attesting witnesses. oe
The attestation clause of the Will in this case appears to be
somewhat defective and the Court mighit well have called for
an affidavit from an attesting witness. But the Court in the
_exercise of its discretion didnot call for further proof. THe
omission to call for further proof is not in the circumstantes of
this case such a defect in the proceedings as entitles the peti-
tioner to ask for revocation of the probate. -, .
Under the Act.and our Rules in force on the date of the
grant, the petitioner was not required to disclose the names of
the persons interested in the estate of the deceased and,-in my
‘view, the.failure to make such disclosure is not a defect in the
proceedings. . Rule’ (a) of Chapter XXXV, which requires the
petitioner to state the names of the relations upon whom the.
estate-would have devolved in the case of intestacy was not in

The proceedings for grant however were defective in
substance because the petitioner ought to have been cited: but
was not cited. As already stated, 'she is.one of the presumptive
-reversioners to the estate of Atul Krishna, and, as such, she was

entitled to special citation: Akhileswari vy. Haricharan (1).

. What, then, is the effect of non-citation of the petitioner?
Does it entitle her to immediate revocation of the grant or docs
it entitle her to revocation only after further investigation.

Under the English practice, if the executor has obtained

“grant in common form in the absence of persons interested, the
person who objects to the, grant enters a caveat and. cites the
exccutor to bring in the grant and leave it in Court so that the’
objector may proceed in due course of law for its revocation.
Concurrently the objector commences an action for revocation
of the probate-by issue of a writ of summons and alleging in the
endorsement of claim on the writ and in the statement of claim
the ‘grounds for revoking the. grant, e.g. invalidity of the Will.
The defendant executor brings in and lodges the grant in_ the
registry and appears to the writ.- The action thus defended:
‘becomes an action for proof in solemn form. “The executor is
put to proof of the Will in solemn form in the presence of the
persons interested. The action is brought by a party whose
interest is adversely affected by the probate in common form.
‘T have given-d summary of the practice which may. be found in
Tristram & Coote’s Probate: Practice (1gth Edition—pages 460,
462, 468,- 472-74, 398-406, 1083, 1058-9, 1159,° 1163-4). ;

; By rule 33 of Chapter XXXV of our Rules the English
practice may be followed-only in matters not provided for by the
Succession Act. The proper course for ascertaining our probate
practice is to examine in the first instance the language of the
Succession Act. Section 263 of the. Act confers a discretion on
the Court to revoke a grant if it was made without citing parties
who ought to have been cited. : Judicial decisions show how this
discretion is to be exercised. In Msst. Ramanandi Kuer v.
Kalawati Kuer (2), where non-citation and genuineness of the
Will were separately put in issue Lord Sinha observed: — —-

' “Relevant illustrations to the sections are (b) ‘The
* ‘grant was made without citing parties who ought to have
_ been cited (c) The will of which probate was obtained was .
. forged or revoked:
“Jt is apparent that the plaintiff in this case sets up both
these “grounds for revocation. The first issue as framed
comes under illustration (b) and ‘the second issue under,
‘. illustration (c). ;
| _ “If these issues were tried separately and the plaintiff
’ succeeded on the first issue, that in itself would have been
sufficient for revoking the probate; but it would still be
open to the defendant to prove the Will and,.if she suc-
_ ceeded, the probate would stand.” , mo
Proof of non-citation of a- person who ought to have been
cited in itself is sufficient ground for revocation. ‘But the en-
quiry on the petition for revocation ought not to be stopped in
limine, for’ Lord ‘Sinha added “but it would still be open to
the defendant to prove the Will and if she succeeded the probate
would stand.” If. the. executor proves the Will the probate.
stands. On such proof the petition for revocation is dismissed.
‘The probate stands, not that a new grant is made. |)
In Saroja Sundari Dassi v. Abhoy Charan Basak (1), the
lower court had revoked the grant on mere proof of non-citation
and on appeal this Court set aside that order observing that “ we
cannot support the order for revocation at this stage; absence of
citation or failure to serve the notice is not sufficient for re-
voking the probate granted ex-parte. The proper course for the.
learned Judge was to give to the appellant an opportunity for
proving the Will in solemn form.
If the Court is satisfied. that the summary grant should be
recalled because’ of the absence of citation, the Court should
‘not revoke the grant summarily. In Premchand Das v.
‘Surendranath Saha (2), this Court set aside a summary order, of
revocation observing that the Judge ought “ to have called upon
the applicant for the grant of letters of administration to prove

the will in solemn form in the presence of the respondent, the
objector, and after hearing the evidence and his objections, he
then ought to have decided whether the order granting the
letters of administration should stand or whether it: should be
revoked.” If the Will is duly proved on further investigation
the petition for revocation is dismissed and ‘the_probate stands
although the proceedings for grant was defective on account of
the absence of special citation. Ibrahim Medda v. Bhola Nath
Lohari (1); and Appeal from Original Order No. 131/50, In the
goods of Bendelal. Ghosh, deceased. "

’ The Court has a discretion under section 263 of the Suc-
cession Act not to revoke and it will not revoke the grant on
account of technical defects in proceedings where the will is duly
proved. t ' ;

‘ _. If the grant is revoked the grantee is required by section 296
of the Act to deliver up the probate in Court. mo,
Pending ‘proof of the Will in solemn form on the petition
of revocation the Court in Elokeshi Dassi v. Hurry Prosad Soor
(2), made the following order: “The probate granted must be
recalled and kept in the record of this court until the case is
decided.” . ;

_ The form of the order in Prem Chand Das v. Surendra Nath
Saha (3), was:—' the letters of administration granted to the
appellants be recalled and the Judge do call upon them to prove
the Will in solemn form in the presence of the respondent, the
objector.’ © + , | }

In both those cases the grant was recalled pending ‘pro-
ceedings for proof.of the Will‘in solemn form and final decision
of the petition for probate. Under the English practice this
is done upon a citation by the executor to bring in the grant
and lodge it in court so that the action for revocation may
proceed. Tristram & Coote’s Probate Practice—igth Edition,
pages 406, 474.1083. The question of recalling the grant pend-
ing the enquiry has not been argued and I therefore do not give
any direction on this point: , ;
