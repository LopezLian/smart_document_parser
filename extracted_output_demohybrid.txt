Alternative Charge—inding— False Evidence—Contradiciory Statements—
Criminal Procedure Code (Act X of 1872), 8. 455, Sch. iii--Penal Code
(Act XLV of 1860), s, 193.

Where a person was convicted of giving false evidence upon an alternative
charge in the form given in Sch. iii of the Criminal Procedure Code,
Held, by the majority of the Court (Jackson and Puras, JJ., dissenting), that

‘the conviction was good, notwithstanding the jury had not distinetly found

which of the two statements charged was false.
Held, per Jaczson, J., that such a charge is bad, and further that an alter-
pative finding upon-such charge is invalid.
_ Held, per Pusan, J., that, although a person may be lawfully tried upon
such a charge, still the Court or jury must, for a conviction, find specifically .
which branch of the alternative is true.

Tux question arising in this case was as to the validity of a
conviction upon a charge of giving false evidence framed
in the alternative. The matter was referred for the opinion of
a Full Bench by Jackson and Mitter, JJ. The facts appear
sufficiently in the observations made by the former Judge on
referring the case. .

Jackson, J.—The offence of which the prisoner is convicted

-is stated in these words:—*‘ That he did, on or about the 23rd

day of January 1873, at Alipore, in the course of the trial of

me to that house (viz., the house at Chitpore), and a small portion
by Belilios and Zahuruddin; and that he did, on or about the

13th day of February 1873, at Alipore, in the course of the trial *

of J. R. Belilios, Tulsi Das Dutt, and Mahomed Latif, in the
same case of cheating, state in evidence before Moulvi Abdul
Latif, Deputy Magistrate at Alipore, that Belilios never sent any
furniture of his own or of any one else to that house (viz., the
house at Chitpore), nor was any of the furnitures in that house
belonging to Belilios ;”—and it is said that one of these two con-
tradictory statements, the prisoner “ either knew or believed to be
false, or did not believe to be true, and that he has thereby
committed an offence punishable under s. 193 of the Indian
Penal Code.” It is not found that one or the other of these
statements is in fact false, or that either of such statements, if
false, was intentionally given, but the conviction manifestly rests
upon the simple circumstance that the two statements are con-
tradictory one of the other. It has been contended that neither
s. 193 or s. 72 of the Indian Penal Code, nor any provision of
the Criminal Procedure Code of 1872, justifies such conviction.
There is a ruling of the Full Bench in the case of The Queen v.
Musst. Zamiran (1) which supports the conviction, but the
authority of that decision has been questioned in several later
cases, viz., the caseof The Queen vy. Mati Khowa ( 2), the case of

always entertained the contrary opinion. I expressed that opinion
Queex on the occasion of a case coming before the English Committee
, °

judgment was given, and a finding
arrived at in what is known as the
alternative form.

I cannot tell from the records in
these cases whether or not such evi-
dence was available, but it seems at
first sight that no attempt was made
to procure it, and whether the alter-
native finding be legally good or not,
it is certainly not in the interests of
Justice to be resorted to, until both
the Committing Officer and the Ses-
sions Judge are satisfied that no
reliable evidence is procurable in sup-
port of one or other of the two
charges.

It is quite certain, however, that we
cannot now obtain any finding of
the Judge on either of the charges
separately, for he is no longer Judge
of the district, nor can we expect
after this lapse of time to obtain any
satisfactory finding on a retrial.

_ I think, therefore, we must take the
record as it stands, and decide upon
that record as to the guilt or inno-
cence of each one of the prisoners.

No. 66.

In this case the prisoners were each
of them charged with giving false
evidence in one or other of the follow-
ing instances, viz. either before the
Magistrate in stating that a certain
person was killed by one Eku, or
before the Sessions Judge in stating
that that certain person died of
snake-bite.

They all pleaded guilty to the first
charge,

The Judge and the assessors were
equally unable to decide upon which
one of the alternative charges, Gahori

Mundul, one of the prisoners, was
guilty; and so the Judge, concurring
with the assessors, came to what is
well known in our procedure as an
alternative finding, to the effect that
Gahori was guilty either of an offence
under the first or under the second
charge, and upon this finding the Judge
sentenced the said prisoner to one
year's rigorous imprisonment.

The Judge differing from the assess-
ors thought himself able to decide that
the rest of the prisonera before us were
guilty of the charge of giving false
evidence when they stated that the
deceased died of snake-bite, and so he
found them guilty under that cbarge,
and sentenced each of them to three
years’ rigorous imprisonment. He
relied entirely on “the evidence of
the medical officer." That evidence
was to the effect that, though the
post mortem examination of the
deceased showed no marks of snake-
bite, and did show marks of violence
such ag to lead him to the opinion that
the deceased died by strangulation, yet
that some of the internal appearances
of death by snake-bite would be like
those of death by strangulation.

This evidence is not, in my judg-
ment, sufficient evidence to warrant
& conviction on the charge that the
prisoners spoke falsely when they said
that the deceased died of snake-bite;
and I would therefore discharge
the prisoners found guilty of thig
charge.

On the other hand, it is said that
the first finding of the Judge is a
legal finding within the meaning of
the Full Bench decision in the case of
The Queen v. Musst, Zamiran (a)

of this Court in 1862, the papers of which case are appended to

this record. It may be suggested that. this reference is not

As I understand that ruling, analter-
native finding to be a legal finding
must proceed upon two statements
absolutely contradictory the one of
the other, and irreconcileable, and
thereby necessarily one or other of
them false. But in this case the two
statements of Gahori are not of this
nature, In the one, according to
the charge, he simply says that Eku
told him he had killed Methi, and in
the other he says he had heard that
Methi had died of snake-bite.

These two statements are clearly
not of a nature to warrant an alter-
_ native finding, and I would therefore
discharge Gshori also.

No. 64.

In this case the prisoner was charged
as in case 66 alternatively with giving
false evidence,

He pleaded guilty to the second
charge: the Judge thought this plea
a false plea; the assessors thought it a
true plea.

But eventually the Judge, differing
from the assessors, found the prisoner
guilty in the alternative form, viz.,
guilty either of the offence of giving
false evidence before the Magistrate,
or of that of giving false evidence
. before the Sessions Court, and the
Judge then sentenced the prisoner
to one yerr’s rigorous imprisonment.

Before the Magistrate the prisoner
positively swore he had seen the
accused beating a man, so that he
died ; before the Sessions Court he as
‘positively swore he had seen no such
beating. .

Iam of opinion, therefore, that when

the two statements to which the
accused on the two several occasions

deposed, were of the nature shown, the

Judge was justified in his findiag—
see the Full Bench ruling I have

above quoted,—and I would therefore

uphold this conviction. -

No. 68.

In this ease the prisoners were
committed to the Sessions on the
alternative chargee of having given
false evidence either in stating that
a certain deceased person was killed
by a particular person, or in stating
that that deceased person committed
suicide.

The prisoners pleaded guilty to the
first charge.

The Judge and the assessors were
equally unable to say which statement
was false and which irue; and the
Judge, therefore, concurring with the
agsessors, came to a finding in the
alternative form, viz,, to the effect that
the accused were guilty either of an
offence before the Magistrate or of
an offence before the Sessions Court,

and the Judge sentenced each one of .

the prisoners to one year's rigorous
imprisonment.

I have read most carefully and more
than once the so-called contradictory
depositions on which the prisoners
have been convicted and sentenced,
and I find that none of the prisoners
said before the Magistrate that the
accused had killed the deceased. On
the contrary one of them distinctly
said she had not seen the accused de
so. Neither did they say before the
Judge that they had seen the deceased
commit suicide. They spoke as from
hearsay only.

I am of opinion, therefore, for the
reasons given in No. 66 that the con-
viction of these prisoners is bad in
law, and I would discharge them.

necessary, inasmuch as the decision of the Full Bench is partly
based on the terms of s, 381 of the old Code of Criminal Proce-

No. 67.

In this case the alternative charge
was of the offence of false evidence
either in stating that onc Kalimuddin
killed a deceased person, or in stating
that one Shukti killed the same
deceased person.

The prisoners pleaded guilty to the
first charge.

The Court concurring with the

assessors found the prisoners guilty in

the alternative form, viz, that they
had given false evidence either in
their respective statements before
the Magistrate, or in their respective
statements before the Sessions Court,
and the Qourt sentenced each of
the prisoners to two years’ rigorous
imprisonment,

In the case of the prisoner Patu,
she swore before the Magistrate that
the
deceased, and before the Sessions
Court that one Shukti did so. But in
making this latter statement, we do
not know whether she was speaking as
from her own knowledge or not, and
the statements are not either of them
necessarily untrue nor even contra-
dictory, for itis possible that both may
have been true, for both Shukti and
Kalimuddin may have together
killed the deceased, and we must give
every doubt in favor of the deceased.

In the case of the prisoner Ono, she
did distinctly say before the Magistrate
that she saw the accused kill the
deceased, but before the Sessions Court
she did not say that she saw Shukti
kill the deceased. On the contrary
she spoke of this from hearsay only.

In neither case, therefore, are the
two contradictory statements sufficient
to warrant an alternative finding, and

both prisoners, therefore, should, I
think, be discharged.

No, 65.

In this case the alternative charge
was that the prisoners gave false
evidence either in stating that a
certain person killed the deceased, or
that the deceased committed suicide.

The prisoners pleaded guilty to the
first charge.

The Court concurring with the
assessors came to the following finding,
viz.,,to the effect that the prisoners
were guilty either of having given
false evidence befure the Magistrate
or before the Sessions Court, and the
Court sentenced the prisoners to one
year's rigorous imprisonment.

There is no doubt that before the
Magistrate the prisoners did distinctly
swear that they saw the accused kill
the deceased. But before the Sessions
Court when they spoke of the suicide
of the deceased, they did go from hear-
say. only.

I think therefore that in this case
there were no such contradictory
statements as to warrant an alternative
verdict, and I would therefore dis-
charge both prisoners.

Marxsy, J.—I think it would be
impossible to find a series of cases
more strongly illustrating than these
the extreme danger of resorting to
alternative findings.

The cases before us comprise
fourteen convictions for perjury.
Thirteen persons, male and female,
some very young, have been con-
victed and sentenced to various terms’
of imprisonment; one woman having
been convicted twice. The prisoners

have even been six months in jail under

HIGH COURT.

dure, which is no longer in force, but I think it cannot be denied
that, if the reasoning of Sir Barnes Peacock in that case is

sentence. The cases, although arising
out of facts originally unconnected,
present features of remarkable similar-
ity. All the prisoners gaveevidencein
the first instance before the Magistrate
against persons who were accused on
various occasions of having commit-
ted crimes of great violence, all or
nearly all amounting to homicide.
From the mass of papers before me,
Ihave not been able to ascertain in
how many different cases the prisoners
were called as witnesses, but there
were certainly several such cases, and
these cases were not apparently in
any way connected.

All the prisoners when they appeared.
as witnesses before the Magistrate gave
evidence unfavorable to the persons
then under accusation.

All the prisoners when they
appeared as witnesses before the
Sessions Judge gave evidence favor-
able to these same persona.

All the prisoners now adhere to
their second statement, and all make
the same defence, namely, that their
first statement was a false statement
made under compulsion put upon them
by the Police.

I gather from the judgment of the
Sessions Judge that in all the cases
he was strongly inclined to believe
that the first statement was the true
one; that he thought the charge of
ill-treatment made against the Police
was unfounded; and that even, if true,
it did not amount to a defence, because
the prisoners were not in fear of
instant death when they made their
first statement..

I infer, however, that he had not
finally made up his mind on these
points, because he does not act upon
this view which would lead to a con-
yiction of all the prisoners on the
charge of giving false evidence before
the Magistrate: in all the cases but
one he convicts the prisoners of hav-
ing given false evidence either before
the Magistrate or before the Sessions
Judze.

When these cases came tkefore
Hobhouse, J.. and myself on the
first occasion, we thought: that a. 381
of the Code of Criminal Procedure
which gives power, when it is doubtful
under which of two sections the offence
falls, to come to a finding in the alter-
native form, did not apply to cases

where the two charges are, as in this 7

case, under the same section; we

thought, therefore, that an alternative
finding was not legal, and sent the
cases back in order that the Sessions
Judge might come to a legal finding.
As however the Judge had, in the
meantime, left the country, that order
could not be complied with.

We must, therefore, deal with the

' cases ag they stand.

I have had the advantage of reading
the jadgment which Hobhouse, J., will
deliver in this case, and for the
reasons he has so fully pointed out the
convictions of seven out of these
thirteen prisoners must fail (a); because
the statements made in each case on
the two occasions, though conflicting
in the sense of one being favorable,
and the other unfavorable to the
person accused, are not so absolutely

contradictory, that it is impossible
that both should be true. It is of
course plain that before a prisoner
can be convicted of perjury on the
ground that he has made two con-
tradictory statements without ascer-
taining which of the two is true, and
which is false, every presumption in
favor of the possible reconciliation of
the statements must be made. On
that ground therefore, apart from
ail other considerations, the convictions
of these prisoners must be quashed. .
With regard to the five prisoners,
Shinduri, Yendi, Punchma, Kishur,
and Bhurru, who have been convicted
ef giving false evidence before the
Magistrate, I do not find upon the
record the evidence upon which the
Bessions Judge relies as satisfying him
that the statements on this oceasion
were false. He relies on the opinion
of the medical officer and on some-
thing which passed before the Magis-
trate in an enquiry which took place
on the spot. But neither the medical
officer nor the Magistrate were called
upon this trial, nor do I find any note
by the Judge that the medical officer's
deposition before the Judge was put
in. There is nothing whatever,
therefore, to support the finding

against these five prisoners. But fur-

ther, as Hobhouse, J., points out,
even ifthe deposition of the medical
officer may be looked at, it does not
negative the statement of these pri-
soners before the Judge that the
death in question occurred from
snake-bite. The convictions of these
five prisoners must, therefore, also be
quashed.

The remaining case is that of
Bidu Noshyo. He is a lad of fifteen.
He maintains like the rest, that the

It is also pointed out that Sch. iii,

story told to the Magistrate was the
untrue one, and that it was made in
consequence of threais by the Police.

The opinions of the assessors in

this case are not as fully reeorded by

the Judge as required by s. 324 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure, but
I gather that, whereas the Judge
thought the statement made on the
second occasion was the false one, the
assessors thought that was true, and
that the statement made on the first
occasion was false.

Now, apart from all questions of
law, I consider that it was ebsolutely
necessary clearly to ascertain in this
case which of these two views was
right. If the view of the assessors
was right, then it seems 40 me
extremely probable that the rest of
the boy’s assertion is true, namely,
that he made his firet statement under
the influence of the Police; and if he
did so it seems to me almost a per-
version of language to call the
making of this false statement a
erime. It may be that in strictness of
law it is so, but it is a crime which I
should visit with no punishment,

An investigation which leaves it
uncertain whether a crime has been .
committed which requires a year’s
rigorous imprisonment, or a crime
which requires no punishment at all,
whether legal or not, is to my mind
highly unsatisfactory ; and Iam unable
to affirm a conviction founded upon
such an investigation. So ,

Upon this view of the case, there-
fore, and differing as regards this
prisoner with much regret from
Hobhouse, J., I would quash this con-
viction also. .

This being so, and all the convic-
tions being disposed of on the merits,

annexed to the Procedure Code, contains the form of an alter-

native charge under s. 193, and from this it may be supposed
that the intention of the Legislature was to make a conviction
in that form perfectly good. As at present advised, I think this
is not so, and on all considerations I think this matter should be
referred to a full Bench for an authoritative ruling.

Mr. Jackson for the prisoner.—The charge, finding, and
couviction in this case are bad. Sch. iii of, the Criminal
Procedure Code contains a form of charge like the present one,
but that form is inconsistent with the body of the Code.

Before the passing of the new Code, an alternative charge was.

not allowed by the law; see The Queen v. Palany Chetty (1),
although in that case a conviction upon such a charge was held
to be good; but the construction there put by the Court upon
s. 242 of the old Code, and which they stated was supported by
reference to the whole enactment, was obviously wrong, as is
apparent: if this section be taken in conjunction with the two

- preceding ones.

the point of law, whether the alter-
native finding is legal when the two
charges are under the same section
does not strictly arise. But as a judg-
ment on this point has already been
delivered by us, I would say that the
words of the section seemed to me so
clear that I could not understand, nor
did I understand, that the Fall Bench
decision in the case of The Queen v.
Muast, Zamiran (a) turned upon this
point, As regards my interpretation
of the Full Bench decision, I am
inclined now to think that I was wrong.
But as regards my interpretation of
the law, with the very greatest respect
‘for the Judges who tock part in that
decision, I still think I am right.

It ia indeed a matter of regret that
there should be any difference of
opinion on such a point, But so far

@s apy expression of the opinions of

The power to frame a charge in the alterna-

Judges of this Court may serve as a
guide to the Courts of original or
inferior appellate jurisdiction, EF
think that no inconvenience ought to
follow, It is clearly the right course
to follow the decision of a Fuli Bench
rather than that of a single Judge.

I wish to repeat, however, that in
my opinion this case most strongly
shows how careful Judges ought to be
in using the powers which s. 381
confers upon them. I believe every
one would agree that that section
was only intended as a last resort,
when it became impossible to ascertain
the truth.

The convictions of all thirteen
prisoners will be reversed, and the
prisoners released.

__ tive was first given by s. 455 of the new Code, but the only
cases in which such a charge is allowable are indicated by
the Illustration to the section, viz., cases in which the facts being
clearly found it is doubtful on those facts what provision of
the law applies; and this view is borne out by other provisions
of the criminal law.

But even if it be held that the present charge isa good
charge under Sch. iii, it is submitted that an alternative find-
ing is inadmissible. There must be a separate charge for every
distinct offence; Criminal Procedure Code, s. 452. When it

is doubtful of which of several offences specified in the judg-

ment the accused is guilty, he is to be punished for the offence
for which the lowest punishment is provided; Penal Code,
s. 72. The jury are to decide which view of the facts is true;
Criminal Procedure Code, s. 257; and it is clear from the
Illustration to the section that, in the case of an alternative
charge for murder or culpable homicide, an alternative finding
that the accused had been guilty of one or the other
would not be permitted. S. 263 enacts that the jury shall
return a verdict on all the charges; if, therefore, in the present
case, instead of a charge framed in the alternative separate
charges had been drawn up,—and this is a matter wholly in the
option of the officer who draws up the charge,—the jury would

_ have been bound to come to a distinct finding on each charge.

Had the alternative charge been compulsory, the argument that
the Legislature, when providing for an alternative charge, meant
an alternative finding to follow, would no doubt have some
force; but as it is, it would seem that the Legislature intended
to deprive juries of the power of returning alternative findings
in cases in which there might be separate charges or heads of

_charge,—a power which it had been decided they possessed under

that “a person who has once been tried for an offence, and
convicted or acquitted of such offence, shall not be liable to be
tried again for the same offence,” the corresponding section, 460,
of the new Code provides that he “shall not be liable to be tried
again on the same facts for the same offence.” It is evident
that this provision would be a dead letter, unless the facts
had been distinctly found on the previous trial: for inetance, it
would be impossible to plead a conviction upon an alternative
finding in a case like the present in bar of a trial for perjury
committed by making the first statement. Neither the case of
The Queen v. Palany Chetty (1), nor the Calcutta Full Bench
decision in The Queen v. Musst. Zamiran (2), meets this difficulty,
which Abbott, C.J., in The King v. Harris (3), describes as
a most material objection, viz., that the defendant might be twice
convicted and punished for perjury if the alternative finding
were admissible. The object of the trial is to solve the ques-
tion whether false evidence has in fact been given, but if the
two depositions only are put in, and no other evidence offered, and
the alternative finding allowed, the question remains unsolved.
Moreover, if such a finding be good, proof of intention is un-
necessary ; the intention clearly cannot be inferred, as it might
be where the jury finds that one statement is false.

Up to the present time the decisions in this Court on this sub-
ject have been conflicting; see The Queen v. Musst. Zamiran (2),
‘The Queen v. Bidu Noshyo (4), The Queen v. Mati Khowa (5),
and The Queen v. Kola (6).

The Advocate-General, offg. (Mr. Paul) for the Crown.—The
jury have clearly found the accused guilty of giving false
evidence. In summing up the Judge told them :—“ Before you
can find him guilty, you must be satisfied that he made one or
other of the statements contained in the charge kuowing that
such statement was false, and intending deliberately to make a
false statement.” (Jackson, J.—That is no part of the refer-
ring order.] It corresponds with the wording of the order. The
question whether a conviction under s. 193 of the Penal Code
for giving false evidence can be based on two statements,

diametrically opposed to each other, can be best determined by
reference to the law of this country before the passing of the
Penal Code. That law, it is submitted, was exactly the same as
the English law before the decision in The King vy. Harris (1).
That case turned upon a purely technical rule of English
law: whereas in this country it would be open for a person who
had been convicted upon a charge like the present one to plead in
bar of a second trial, “I was convicted on a charge including:
the one now made of giving false evidence on the trial of 4.”

[Jacxson, J.—How would it be if the two statements were

made, one in the course of a criminal trial, and the other in
a civil proceeding ?] That could only affect the degree of
certainty. The Penal and Criminal Procedure Code do aWay
with the necessity of proving which of the two statements is
false. The contradictory nature of the statements is in itself
proof that one or the other is false—The Queen v. Ross (2).
The new Criminal Procedure Code, Sch. iii., legalizes a charge
framed in the alternative; and Place vy. Potts (3) shows that,
when the Legislature has legalized a form of declaration, euch
form isnot demurrable. [PHean, J.—The form given in Sch. iii
would not apply to statements made in two different Courts,
it is only with respect to statements made on the preliminary
enquiry and on the trial.] That is just the present case. Then
if the offence is well described in the charge, both the finding
and conviction upon the charge are valid. In The Queen v.
Narain Doss (4), a conviction on an alternative charge was held
good... The words “ view of the facta,” in.s. 257 of the Criminal
Procedure Code, refer to the views respectively taken by the
prosecutor and the accused as to the guilt or innocence of the
latter. There is no conflict of cases on the point. In The
Queen v. Mati Khowa (5) and The Queen vy. Kola (6), the
statements were not necessarily contradictory, and in all the cases
decided in The Queen y. Bidu Noshyo (7), both statements might
have been true.

The following judgments were delivered by the Full Bench :-—

Morris, J. (Brrcu, J., concurring),—I think it sufficient to
Bay upon this reference that, in my opinion, the conviction
arrived at by the jury upon two charges framed in the alter-
native form, according to the model given in Sch. iii of the

Criminal Procedure Code, is good:in law. It seems to me that.

the two statements embodied in each charge, which were made
by this prisoner, must be taken together, aud that when so taken
together, they comprehend the specific offence of intentionally
giving false evidence in a stage of a judicial proceeding. It is
possible that each of the statements, and not one of them merely,
was in itself false, and that taken singly, each might have
afforded good ground for a distinct charge of an offence under
8. 193 of the Penal Code. But this course was not followed; the
simpler course allowed by the law was adopted of framing a
charge containing two contradictory statements of such a nature
that the two, when taken in combination, disclosed the specific
offence of intentionally giving false evidence. It must be matter
of evidence whether the contradictory statements contained in
the charge are per se 80 irreconcileable that one of them is
necessarily false, and also that the prisoner in making them
intentionally spoke falsely in regard to one of them. This it is
the province of the jury or Court to determine, and, in the
present instance, the jury had no difficulty in arriving at such
a determination. It seems clear that the new Code of Criminal
Procedure has expressly contemplated, and indeed provided for,
thie result. When s, 442 provides that the charge may be in
the form given in the 3rd Schedule, and when the 3rd Schedule
gives an alternative form of charge in these words,—‘« That you,
on or about (such a date and place), in the course of the inquiry
into (such a matter) and before (such an officer), stated in evidence
(such and such words); and that you, on or about (such another
date and place), in the course of the trial of (so and 80), before
(such an officer), stated in evidence (such and such other words),
one of which statements you either knew or believed to be
false, or did not believe to be true, and thereby committed an

Quesx one of the other, so that the contradiction involvesjof necessity a

Hoostayoon

Susw. that he by so doing deliberately intended to speak falsely,
the substantive offence of intentionally giving false evi-
dence in a stage of a judicial proceeding is thereby established,
‘and no need exists to determiné by distinct evidence. which
one of the two statements is absolutely false. No doubt,
strictly speaking, this form of charge is not an alternative
charge in the sense contemplated by s. 455 of the Criminal
Procedure Code, ‘This is not a case where two or more offences
are disclosed by the single act or set of acts committed, or rather
alleged to have been committed, by the accused, and it is doubt-
ful what particular offence in law can be found on the facts
proved; but the alternative consists in this, that of two state-
ments made by the accused one or other of them, it does not
matter which, inasmuch as the two involve an absolute contra-
diction, must be of such a nature that the person {making it
either knew or believed it to be false, or did not believe it to be
true. It is, as already said, expressly to meet this particular
kind of offence that Sch. iii contains a specific form
described as a form for “ alternative charges on s. 193” of the
Indian Penal Code. If it were intended that the jury or Court
should find which of the two statements set. out in the charge
was false, not only would this form be cumbrous and unmeaning
as an alternative form, but the force of the two contradictory
statements in combination would be entirely lost, so as to enable
such jury or Court to determine that the accused knew or
believed one of the statements to be false, or did not believe
it to be true, and that he thereby committed an offence under
s. 193 of the Indiau Penal Code.

AINSLIE, J.—-I am also of opinion that the conviction on a
charge framed in the form given in the 3rd Schedule of Act X
of 1872 is good, although it may not declare which of the two
statements set out in the charge is false. By s. 442 of the Act,
a charge in that particular form is declared to be a good and
‘valid charge. If it is a good charge to try a man on, it appears

to me to follow of necessity that it must-be a good charge to
convict him on; and there is nothing in s. 461 which requires
that the circumstances which constitute the offence should be
set out in the conviction. It appears to me that this is not a
ease which comes under the second part of the section which
refers to offences punishable under different sections, or parts of
a section, of the Penal Code, but that it falls under the first part
of s. 461. If the Court comes to the conclusion that the

accused person must of necessity have given false evidence, it is

sufficient, under the first part of s. 461, to state in the convic-
tion that he has given false evidence, and is therefore punishable
under s. 193 of the Penal Code.

Markey, J.—I am of opinion that a conviction in the form
in which this prisoner has been convicted upon a charge i in the
same form is good in law.

It appears to me that this is a case to which the 2nd clause
of s, 461 has no application. The offence of which the. prisoner
has been convicted is giving false evidence, and the section of the
Penal Code under which he has been convicted is 8. 193. There
is no necessity, therefore, for resorting to the alternative given
in the 2nd clause of s. 461, and it need not be further
considered.

Nor does it appear to me that s, 455 has any application ,

either. There was not in this case “a single act or set of acts
of such a nature that it was doubtful which of several offences
the facts which could be proved would constitute.” The facts
which could be proved even if they are to be treated as a a single
set of acts, could only constitute the offence of giving false
evidence under s. 193, and no other.

The only. question which it appears to me that we have to
consider in this case is whether a charge in this form is
sufficient, If it is sufficient, then it appears to me to follow as a
matter of course that a conviction which follows the words of the
charge must be good also. And whatever might otherwise be
my own opinion in the matter, I think we are precluded from
saying that this is not a good charge, seeing that it is in the very
form given by the 3rd Schedule, and the Act provides (s. 442)
that the charge may be in the form therein given.

BENGAL LAW REPORTS. - [VOL. XI.

It is said that the Legistature will thus, by the form in which

they have drawn the charge, have altered the definition of the

offence of giving false evidence as given under the Penal Code,
which was not their intention. I am not sure that this is the
effect of what has been done. But even if it is so, the Legis-
lature must, I think, be taken to have been aware, when they laid
down these forms authoritatively, that the form in which a charge
is laid does affect materially the evidence which is necessary to
support it, and that by changing the evidence which is necessary
to support a conviction for an offence, the nature of the offence
itself may sometimes be changed. I think there could not be here
any accidental omission or oversight, his form of charge
must have been given to meet this very case. I think, therefore,
I am bound to consider this to be a good charge, and to apply
to it the usual rule which I understand to be this, that a
charge is proved when all the material averments in it are
proved. Here the finding is that all the averments are true:
and a conviction in these terms is certainly a good conviction,

though I should have thought it equally good if it had merely

been that the prisoner was guilty of giving false evidence, as that
would have been equivalent to a finding that the charge as
laid was proved.

Pazar, J.—The matter before us entirely depends upon the
right construction to be placed upon certain portions of the
existing Criminal Procedure Code, and if, in considering the
question which has been put to us in this reference, we were
restricted from travelling beyond the limits of the actual text
of that Code, I think I should be led without difficulty to the
opinion that the verdict of the jury ought not merely to find
that the one or the other branch of the alternative charge
made against the prisoner.in the present case is true, but ought
to specify which of the two branches is true.

The charge is a statement, express and implied (ss. 439 and 440),
of the facts which the prosecution undertakes to establish by
evidence against the accused, and several sections of the Code
are directed to enacting that it shall generally be precise,
single, and unambiguous.

The prosecution may (with certain limitation) at one and the

VOL. XIIL.] HIGH COURT.

same trial offer to the jury several views of the facts, either of
one, so to’ speak, criminal occurrence, or of several criminal
occurrences, according to which views the prisoner’s conduct in
each occurrence amounts to the commission of a corresponding
offence (ss, 452, 453, 454, and 455). If there are several views of
the same occurrence, then the offence varies with the section or
part of a section, within which the particular view brings it: if
they are views of several occurrences, then the corresponding
offences may fall within the same section. And it is important
in reference to a Full Bench decision which will be presently
mentioned to bear this distinction in mind.

These several views of the facts should generally be exhibited
in a succession of distinct charges (s. 454); but (in the case
at any rate of their being only alternative statements of one
criminal occurrence) they may be put in the shape of an
alternative charge (8. 455 explained by the Illustration).

And whether alternative views of the facts of one criminal
occurrence are exhibited in a series of charges, or in one
alternative charge, if the Court is doubtful which is established
by the evidence, it must expressly say so, and in that event will
pass judgment in the alternative according to s. 72 of the
Penal Code (para. 2,8. 461). In all other cases it would seem,
at least inferentially, the Court must pass judgment separately
on the view of facts involved in each charge.

- The duty of the jury as a part of the Court is also, plainly,
to decide which of the several views of facts presented to it for
consideration by the prosecution is true (8. 257), and to say
specifically as to the view of facts exhibited in each charge
whether it is true or not (s. 263). There is no relief from this
obligation to come to an express finding with regard to each
alleged view or set of facts, except that which is by implication
given in para. 2, 8. 461, just referred to, and that paragraph
applies, as it seems to me, only to cases where the several
sets of facts are the alternative representations of one criminal
occurrence.

- But the alternative views of facts stated in the charge which
is now under our consideration are not alternative views of one
criminal occurrence ; they represent two entirely distinct crimiual

1874 occurrences: the one being to the effect that the accused, on the
Quen 23rd January 1873, at Alipore, in the course of a trial of two
Manomen persons on a charge of cheating before Moulvi Abdul Latif,
Hoomayoon . . . *

Susw. stated in evidence, &c., which statement he, at the time of
making it, knew to be false, &c.; the other that the accused, on
the 13th February 1873, in the course of the trial of these same
‘two persons, together with a third person on the same charge —
before the same Magistrate, stated in evidence, &c., which state-

ment, &c. And, therefore, if the scope and spirit of ss. 455 and
461, para, 2, are that which I have above described, this
case does not fall within either of them. In other words, there
| does not appear to be in the text of the Criminal Procedure
, Code any warrant for an alternative charge of this kind, or for
| an alternative finding of these two substantively different sets
| _ (or views) of facts, whether exhibited in an alternative charge or
in two separate charges. Consequently, if the text alone of
the Code were consulted, it would not, as I understand it,
support the conviction which is before us.
7 And this is not a matter of mere technical regularity ; it very
 glosely touches upon the right and satisfactory administration
: of justice. Obviously, it might be of the greatest possible
- moment to the persons who were being tried before the Magis-
trate on the 23rd January and 13th February, that it should be
distinctly established in the case now before us which of the two
. statements alleged to have been made by the present accused on |
those two days respectively, was false. And, therefore, a proce-
dure which would enable the prosecution in the present case to
| procure a conviction of the accused in the alternative, without
, troubling itself to go the length of establishing the falsehood of
the one statement or the other, might work a serious grievance
to those persons. Again, the present accused person himself. by
an alternative conviction is deprived of the advantage which he
ought to have in the event of a material witness to the falsity
of one of the statements being convicted of perjury.
If, also, the prosecution is not under a legal obligation to
establish the falsity of either statement, then it is plain that it
~ may launch its case upon the bare evidence that the two alleged
statements were respectively made, and then leave the prisoner

~ VOL, X1I.J HIGH COURT.

to satisfy the Court as best he can that neither of them was false.
This is the course which is most usually taken, and I do not
hesitate to say that it is generally most unfair. The contradic-
tion between the two statements is seldom absolute, though there
is commonly enough opposition in them to lead a not over and
scrutinizing jury to presume it; and the contradiction being
arrived at, the falsity, again, is presumed in spite of anything
which the prisoner may say in the dock. Convictions of this
character are most unsatisfactory and do very little to meet any
real mischief. Yet the temptation to the public prosecutor
to seek them is so great, that in this country perjury is hardly
ever attacked in any other way. Deliberate perjury, persisted
in, is not often the subject of prosecution in the mofussil Courts.
Several other considerations of public importance might be
brought forward, but it seems to be sufficiently plain, without
more, that perjury is the one offence of ail others in the Penal
Code which calls for precision and unambiguousness of state-
ment in the charge and in the judicial finding.

Thus it appears to me that the construction of the text of the
Criminal Procedure Code, taken by itself, which I have arrived
at, accords with the expediency of the matter, and that thereby
its reasonableness is in some degree supported.

However, when we pass on from the text of the Criminal Pro-
cedure Code to the forms of charges in Sch. iii appended to the

Code, which are prescribed for adoption by s. 442, we find
the last of them runs as follows :—

* That you, or on about the day of > at ,1n
the course of the inquiry into , before > stated in
evidence that “ ”, and that you, on or about the day
of > at , in the course of the trial of ;
before , Stated in evidence that * » ,one of whicn
statements you either knew or believed to be false, or did not
believe to be true, and thereby, &c.”

Now, inasmuch as an alternative charge is only referable to
s. 455, the fact that the Legislature has authorized this form,
seems to show that s. 455 was intended to extend, as it well may,
beyond its Illustration, that is to say, to the alternative allega-
tion of different occurrences, at any rate in the particular case

which is covered by this form. And it has been argued from

‘the form itself that the finding of the jury and the judgment of

the Court-may, when such an alternative charge as this is pre-

ferred, bein the alternative. But s. 461, para. 2, certainly

does not here apply, and it is difficult to see how the distinct
provisions of s. 257 can be escaped.

The Full Bench ruling,in the case of The Queen v. Mussi.
Zamiran (1), decided that, under the late Criminal Procedure
Code, there: might be an alternative finding, as well in a case in
which the evidence proves the commission of one of two offences
falling within the same section of the Penal Code and it is doubtful
which of such offences has been proved, as in one in which the
evidence proves the commission of an offence falling within one
of two sections of the Penal Code and it is doubtful which of two
sections is applicable. This ruling, if it could be adopted now,
would therefore support the finding in the present case. The
reasoning, however, by which it was arrived at depended upon
two sections of the old Code, which are not present in the new
Code. The first of these sections was s, 242, which, so far as
itis now necessary to quote it, ran thus:—* When it appears to the
Magistrate that the facts whch can be established in evidence show
the commission of one of two or more offences falling within the
same section of the said Code, but it is doubtful which of such
offences will be proved, the charge shall contain two or more heads
charging each of such offences.” This was held to justify the
framing a charge containing two heads, apparently similar in
substance to that which is under our. consideration, And
although this section, 242, of the old Code is not repeated in the

— new Code, ita substitute being the present 8. 455, yet, so far as

concerns the case before us, the double-headed charge may be
said to be justified by the last form of Sch. iii, Thus we are
under the existing Code, as well as under the old, carried over
the first steps towards the Full Bench conclusion. And the
double-headed charge of two offences having been in this way
arrived at, the Full Bench made its second step upon the foot-
ing of s, 382, cl. 5, which authorized the jury to find in the _

(1) B. L. R., Sup. Vol., 421,

==================================================

- VOL. XTIE.] HIGH. COURT.

alternative upon a double-headed charge. But there is no equi-
“valent to this in the present Code. The jury. are now bound to
‘find which view of the faets is true(s. 257), subject only, as before-
‘mentioned, to such qualification as is to be found in s. 461,
para. 2, which appears to be purposely so framed as to
exclude an alternative finding of two offences falling under
the same undivided section of the Penal Code. It is carefully

worded so as to cover the cases belonging to the first part of the

old 8. 242, but omits those of the second part, among which
the Full Bench case and the present case come.

It was thrown out during the argument in this case that the
“ view of the facts,” with regard to which the jury are by ». 257
called upon to decide whether it is true or not, is in a double-
headed charge the, so to speak, entire alternative view
expressed in the charge. But this does not accord with
the natural meaning of the words. An alternative charge of
the kind for which this construction of the sentence is especially
wanted, puts forward two views of the facts which are incon-
sistent with each other, and which might, if the prosecution had
so chosen, been made the subject of a separate charge: either the
accused told the truth on the first occasion and falsehood on the
second, or vice versd.

It has been said that the prosecution, by alleging in the
charge that the accused stated this on the first occasion and
stated that on the second, and that one of these two statements
was false, presents but one view of the facts to the jury. But
it appears to me plain that this is not correct. The true effect
of the charge is to put forward in a concise form at least
two perfectly distinct views of facts, always inconsistent with
each other, in those cases for which the ambiguous conviction .is
most zealously demanded, namely, in those cases where it
is assumed to be patent on the face of the two statements
that, if either one of them is true, the other must be false.
And the very reason for thus putting forward two views is
that the prosecution cannot venture to assert which view is
true. When, then, the Legislature says that it is the duty
of the jury to decide which view of the facts is true, it can
hardly mean that, in the event of two inconsistent views being in

this way simultaneously offered to the jury, with the implied
admission on the part of the prosecution that it cannot aay
which is true, it is enough if the jury finds that either the one or
the other is true. Moreover, if the authorization of a double-
headed or alternative charge, by the force of implication alone,
authorized a general finding on the evidence that such a charge
was made out in one or other of its branches, then it is difficult
to see why the express provisions of s. 461, para, 2, were enacted in
reference to one class only of double-headed or multiform-headed
charges; for they could hardly have been intended merely to
introduce s. 72 of the Penal Code into the Criminal Procedure
Code. Plainly, by the spirit of s. 455, if not by its words,
charges which might under its provisions be put in the alterna-
tive, but which are nevertheless left to stand separately, may be
dealt with by the Court as if they had been presented in
the alternative, and if it is a consequence of an alternative
charge that the Court is relieved from the obligation to find
which head of it is true, then it seems to follow that s. 461, para.2, .
is partial and superfluous, 7 |

At first I was disposed to think that the Legislature, by intro-
ducing into Sch. iii the alternative form applicable to the
present case, indirectly, if not expressly, intimated its acceptance
of the Full Bench ruling in the case of Zhe Queen vy.
Musst. Zamiran (1), and virtually incorporated the law
enunciated by it in the new Act, and this would probably
have been so, if the new Act did not substantially differ from the
old Actin the particulars which furnished the foundation for
the Fuil Bench decision. But I have already pointed out that
these particulars are absent from the new Act. The reasoning
by which the late Chief Justice arrived at the conclusion
in that case could not. be supported upon the basis of the
present Act. It appearing then that the Legislature, when pass-

‘ing the new Act, entirely removed the foundation on which the
ruling of the Full Bench was placed, we cannot safely infer

from the introduction of the alternative form of charge alone,
which answered at most to the first part only of that ruling, that
the entire ruling was intended to be enacted.

On the whole, then, thoughI admit not without great hesita- -

tion, I have reached the opinion that under the existing
Criminal Procedure Code while, no doubt, an accused person
may be lawfully tried upon an alternative or double-headed
charge, such as that which is brought before us in this reference,
still the Court or jury must, for a conviction, find specifically
which branch of the alternative or head of charge is true.

Jackson, J.—Having given to the very important question
raised in this case the best consideration in my power, I come
to the conclusion to which I first inclined that the finding and
conviction are insufficient,

No one can feel a stronger respect than I do for the opinion
of Sir Barnes Peacock in such a matter ag this, and no one can
be more averse to disturbing settied rules of law, but I feel it,
for reasons which I shall state in the sequel, to be a duty still
more imperative than that of respecting decisions, to express my
dissent from a ruling which I think in effect adds to the Penal
Code an offence not defined by the Legislature.

It seems to me that neither s. 242 of the repealed Code, nor
8. 455 of the present Code of Criminal Procedure (apart from
the form in Sch. iii to which I shall presently advert)
warranted the exhibition of a charge like that before us, and my
persuasion is yet stronger that nothing, at all events in the
existing Code, which is the material question, justifies a finding
and conviction in such terme.

It is not requisite now that I should give at any length my
_ reasons for dissenting from the Full Bench decision which is based
upon repealed enactments; but I may say that, while I admit
the latter clause of the old s. 242 to embrace charges of false
evidence based upon statements given at different times, contra-
dictory of each other, I conceive the Legislature to have had

in view in framing that section the uncertainty as to which of the.

offences would be proved, and therefore to have contemplated the
necessity of proving one or other statement to be false and
therefore to amount to an offence, and that it did not sanction
the mere entangling of the accused in a logical snare from
which, as a matter of reason, he could not escape. As far, more-

Sp MOMED But I find no provision in the Code of 1872 replacing the
Seaw. latter portion of s, 242, On the other hand the Legislature
seeing, it may be, the dangerous ambiguity of that clause, has
recast the whole. section, and dropping the last clause entir ely;
has put the other into new words, which seem to admit of no
misiuterpretation ; for while the charge, alternative as to fact, but
identical as to offence, is excluded, the many-headed charge
arising when several distinct offences are comprised in one section
(as in's, 382, Indian Penal Code) is preserved in the Schedule.
S. 452 provides “ that there must be a separate charge for every
distinct offence of which any person is accused, and every such
charge must be tried separately except in the cases hereinafter —
excepted.” The only exceptions to this rule are contained in:
ss, 453 and 454, and I do not find that the present case falls
within either of them. Further, s, 440 declares that “the charge
shall contain’ such particulars as to the time and place of the
alleged offence and the person against whom it was committed as’.
are reasonably sufficient to give notice to the’ accused person of
the matter with which he is charged;” ands, 441 goes on to
declare that, “when the nature of the case is such that the
particulars mentioned in ss. 439 and 440 do not give sufficient
notice to the accused person of the matter with which he is
charged, the charge shall also contain such particulars of the:
manner in which thé offence was committed as will be sufficient
for that purpose.” One of the Illustrations to this section,
- (¢), is to this effect:—“ 4 is accused of giving false evidence
at a given time and place. The charge must set out -
that portion of the evidence given by A, which is alleged
to be false.” There is nothing in the text of the Criminal
Procedure Code which qualifies these clear provisions in the
case of perjury.

Giving false evidence ia a stage of a judicial proceeding by:
stating falsely before the Magistrate, &c., &c., is a distinct offence,

allege that 4 had either given false evidence at a certain time  Quemn
and place against X by saying so and go, or given false evidence pMarounn
at a certain other time and place against the Queen, by saying Suaw. -
something else? I think it would not. :

But we are told that a charge, if not in accordance with |
these sections, is expressly authorised by the 3rd Schedule,
which no doubt may be read as part of s, 442, having been
removed to the end of the Act merely for the sake of con-
venience to avoid interruption of the sense. The section says :—
‘The charge may be in the form given in the 3rd Schedule
to this Act, or to the like effect;” and where a form so given
seems to be directly at variance with precise rules contained in
the Code itself, I prefer to stand by the rules.

But the composition of the Schedule, and in particular the
place allotted to this very form of charge with the wording of
it, appear to me to indicate that it has suffered from one of the
inadvertencies almost unavoidable in the preparation of so long
and intricate an Act. The 3rd Schedule is divided into two parts:
I. Charges with one head; II. Charges with two or more heads,

On the first I need not observe. The second is framed to
answer the purposes of s. 455 in the same way thats. 248 of |
the repealed Code waa subservient to a. 242.

But while those two sections used in common the expression
“ heads of charge,” it is disused in s. 455 (“in the alternative,”
being employed instead) aud appears only in the Schedule, where,
on the other hand, the term “ alternative” does not appear except
to denote the peculiar form under s. 193, Indian Penal Code, . |
which, however, is a matter quite different from what is spoken
of as alternative in s. 455. And curiously enough the Schedule
gives no form of charge upon the most obvious and usual alter-
native case, viz., that of doubt between the offence of theft
and that of criminal breach of trust. On the other hand, a
variety of charges with more than one head are supplied, which |
have been rendered useless by s. 456 ors. 457. For instance,
why need a Magistrate now draw up several heads of charge
against an accused for murder, culpable homicide, grievous hurt,
and so forth, when, upon acharge of murder or of culpable

Manomen The form called “alternative charges on s, 193,” comes
Hoomayroon . «yee +, 8 *

Suaw. also into this division, though it is not a charge with several
heads at all, but something entirely distinct, and, as I think,
not warranted by any section of the Code at all.

I pause here to remark that the old Code provided forms
of conviction, the present Code does not. And while the old
Code, setting out forms of charge with several heads for
doubtful cases, provided alternative forms of conviction, the
new Code gives in the Schedule several many-headed charges,
and one alternative charge. .
Having said this I return to the wording of this charge. It
does not run,—that you, on or about the
intentionally gave false evidence by stating 3
and thereby committed ;
or that you, on or about ,
| intentionally gave | ’
and thereby committed ;
| but—* that you, on or about the , stated in evidence
, and on ot about | > stated ’
one of which statements you either knew or believed to be
false, &c., and thereby committed an offence.”
That is to say, the offence is made to consist of having
. imade first the one statement, afterwards the other, one of them
being false, though the Magistrate has not been able to deter-
mine, perhaps not taken the trouble to inquire, which.

Now, besides that the offence here stated ie not that defined by
the Penal Code, and required to be set out by the Criminal

| Procedure Code, namely, the intentional making of a particular

- false statement, but simply the making of two statements at
different times, one or other of them being known to be false,
it will be observed that, so far as this form of charge goes, the
two statements need not be contradictory one of the other. Also
that in fact the two statements, though contradictory, may both
be false, and not one only. As for instance, if the witness
swore on the preliminary enquiry that he had seen the accused
without provocation strike the deceased a blow with a club,

such statement being prompted by enmity, and afterwards on (1874
the trial swore that he had not seen the accused strike the  QU5ms
deceased at all, this latter statement being brought about by PA ROMED
the receipt of a large bribe, the fact being that the witness had Saw.
seen the accused, when irritated by the foulest insult, strike the

deceased a blow with his fist, which blow, contrary to probability,

produced death.

It appears to me, therefore, that the form in question is
neither consistent with the positive provisions of the Code as
to charges, nor sufficient for the purposes which it seems to
contemplate. |

One may indeed suspect that it was framed to meet, not the
definition of any offence as contained in the Penal Code, but
either the ruling of the Full Bench in The Queen v. Musst.
Zamiran (1), or the exposition of the law of perjury promulgated |
by the Nizamut Adawlut in their Circular Order No. 126 of
volume IIT, and No. 10 of volume IV (2). In the first mentioned
Circular Order that Court directed (overruling a previous .
reported decision ef two Judges, of whom one was the illustrious
Colebrooke) that, where a prisoner was arraigned for perjury on
two contradictory statements, it would not be necessary to
prove the falsity of either. In the second Circular Order they
prescribed a form of charge, which at all events had the merit
ef being exact and complete according to the views which the
Court at that time entertained. —

It may be observed that the establishment of perjury by con-
tradictory statements is taken from the Mahomedan law, as
expounded by the law officers of the Sudder Court in an
elaborate opinion printed in No, 656 of the Constructions (the
passage will be found at page 21 of the 2nd volume, 4th edition).

The Sudder Judges, however, in adopting it annexed to it an
important qualification, viz., that the contradiction should be on
a point material to the issue of the case. This restriction, in
accordance with the present law as to giving false evidence,
would be and ia held unnecessary, so that the charge before us

is going beyond Sudder practice, and is in fact pure Mahomedan
law of the Muftis.

We are not concerned at present with the enquiry whether
the law should be so, but have only to consider whether it is so
or not. |

I have hitherto discussed the matter with reference to the
charge, and I now turn to the conviction, upon which I found
arguments, which appear to me conclusive of the matter.

In the first place it may be well to state what, in my view, .
according to the Code of Criminal Procedure, is the bearing

which the charge has upon the conviction. The charge I take

to be, first, a notice to the prisoner of the matter whereof he is
accused, and it must convey to him with sufficient clearness and
certainty that which the prosecution intends to prove against
him, and of which he will have to clear himself; second, it is
an information to the Court, which ia to try the accused of the
matters to which evidence is to be directed. And by the forms
and illustrations provided, the Legislature no doubt indicates
what in certain instances it deems to be a sufficient compliance
with the rules which it has laid down.

‘Thus it may be that the framers of the law intended to farnish,
in reference to s. 193 of the Penal Code, a convenient aud
suitable form in which an accusation founded of contradictory,
and probably false, statements might be exhibited, though it
seems to me that the intention has not been successfully carried
out. But precise and positive rules apply to the conviction,
and a judgment of conviction which is not in conformity with

‘those rules is bad in law.

S. 461] declares that “ the sudgment, | if the accused person
be convicted, shall distinctly specify the offence of which, and
the section of the Indian Penal Code under which he is con-
victed; or if it be doubtful ‘under which of two sections, or
under which of two parts of the same section, such offence falls,
the Court shall distinctly express the same and pass judgment
sn the alternative.” The accused cannot be convicted of matter
not contained in the charge except as provided in ss. 456 and
457, but however loosely the charge may have been framed, the
conviction must be precise except in the particular cases, now

very accurately defined, where the Jaw allows an alternative
judgment.

361
1874

QusEx

If the trial in a Court of Session is held with the aid of Manomrn

assessors, the Judge with whom the decision rests must record
“the point or points for determination, the finding thereupon,
and the reasons for the finding” (s. 464). If the trial is by
jury, a partition of functions takes place, and it is the duty not
of the Court, but of the jury “to decide which view of the
facts is true” (s. 257), and it must appear in the Judge’s record
of the heads of his charge to them that the proper point or
points for determination have been laid before the jury. And
therefore I think it clear that, when the prisoner is charged
with having given false evidence in making this statement or
that, the finding must be express ;—

1st.—Because an alternative finding will not satisfy the
requirements of s. 461. |

2nd.—Because there is no other warrant for any kind of
alternative finding. .

3rd.— Because a bare finding that he has given false evidence
will not suffice; for the definition of false evidence ins. 191,
Indian Penal Code, demands the making of some statement
which is false, and by s. 441, Code of Criminal Procedure,
Tilustration (c), the particular statement must be set out, whereas
the jury here has not found that either statement is false.

4th.—If it be @ question raised in the charge which of the
two contradictory statements is false (if only one be charged as
false), then it would seem that the jury, as having the duty of
deciding which view of the facts is true, must find that this
or that statement is proved to be false, or that both are found,
or that neither is found to be false.

And it seems to me highly inexpedient that an ambiguous

verdict of the kind contended for should be permissible, for it

is obvious that the degree of criminality involved in such a
charge may vary almost infinitely ; for as already observed the
more venial or the more wicked of the two statements, or both,
might have been false; and one of the many consequences would
be that, from the uncertainty of the facts found, the Appellate
Court would be quite unable often to exercise any control, or

even express an opinion as to the measure of punishment which

‘was proper in the case. Other embarrassments and other

unsatisfactory results might ensue. If, for instance, one of the
false statements charged had been in support of a charge of
murder, the accused, if he were convicted, might, in a certain
case, be punished with death under s. 194. Could the Court
which tried him tack on to an alternative as to fact, a second
alternative as to offence, and say that he had either given false
evidence, for which he might be hanged under that section, or

given some other false evidence by which he could be imprisoned |

only under s, 193; and although, if this could be done, the

Court would be bound under s. 72, Indian Penal Code, to

award the lighter punishment, would it be desirable, would
justice be satisfied, if so momentous an issue were left undeter-
mined as to whether the prisoner had or had not given false
evidence with intention, and had thereby caused an innocent
person to be convicted and executed in consequence of his false
evidence?

Nor does the question apply only to the case of false evidence.
At least one other instance occurs to me, in which, if the argu-
ments for the Crown be well-founded, analogy would authorize
an alternative finding. I mean the offence of bigamy.

There is a case in Hale called The Lady Madison’s case (1).

A married B, and afterwards during B’s life married C. B

then dying, but in the lifetime of @ she married D. Thus,

marriage of A with D was not bigamy, because, B living, the
marriage to C’ was void. Now let us suppose that in this case,
the evidence left it in doubt whether B had been living at the
time of A’s marriage with C. Could A have been charged
alternatively with having committed bigamy either with C or
with D,—for, if B was then living, the marriage with C would
be bigamy, but if he was dead, then the marriage with C
would be good, and the marriage with D bigamy,—and could
she be. convicted on such alternative charge ?
I conclude, therefore, that the conviction in this case is not
sustainable, and I would order the appellant to be discharged.
The contrary, no doubt, was held seven years ago by a Full
(1) 1 Hale's Pl. Gr., 693 (p. 692, ed. of 1800).

Bench of this Court. The precedent has been followed, though
it has always appeared to me unwillingly by the Division
Benches, and there is this further reason for adhering to it now
that the ruling has been adopted by the High Court of Madras.
But this does not bind my conscience. The Courts are bound
to solve to the best of their ability questions of law which arise
in the course of their business; and if these questions relate to
civil rights or obligations, and the rule becomes settled, persons
begin to shape their conduct thereby, and numerous titles are
_ founded thereupon, and the mischief of unsettling titles far
outweighs the benefit of securing scientific accuracy of decision.
If scores of men, however, have been improperly convicted and
punished on erroneous views of the law, that is not in my
opinion a good reason for proceeding to convict and .punish
others on the same view. The Courts are not empowered to
inflict penalties for that which the law has not constituted an
offence, nor are Courts which are subject to a code of proce-
dure, in cases provided for by that code, authorized to act
otherwise than in accordance with the procedure’ enjoined.
The Legislature might, of course, if it thought fit, prescribe a
punishment for contradictory statements, material or otherwise
made before a Court of Justice, as an impediment in the way of
justice, though, whether in so doing, an equally serious mischief
might not be done by as it were constraining men through fear
of certain punishment to cleave to false statements once made,
may be worth considering. And if the occurrence of this case
should have the effect of bringing about an authoritative decla-
ration by the Legislature one way or the other, I shall not regret
having brought the matter under the serious attention of my
colleagues.

Coucn, C.J. (Kemp, J., concurring).—The charge in this
case against the accused was first “that he did, on or about the
23rd of January 1873, at Alipore, in the course of the trial of
Tulsi Das Dutt and Mahomed Latif ona charge of cheating,

portion by Belilios and Zahuruddin; and that he did, on or
about the 13th of February 1873, at Alipore, in the course of
the trial of J. &. Belilios, Tulsi Das Dutt, and Mahomed
Latif in the same case of cheating, state in evidence before
Moulvie Abdul Latif, Deputy Magistrate of Alipore, that
Belilios never sent any furniture of his own or of any one

else to that house (viz., the house at Chitpore), nor was any of

the furnitures in that house belonging to Belilios, ” one of which
statements he either knew or believed to be false, or did not
believe to be true, and that he had thereby committed an
offence punishable under s. 193 of the Indian Penal Code.
The second charge is similarly framed, and states that the
accused gave evidence on the 23rd of January 1873 and the
13th of February 1873 at Alipore, and that he either knew or
believed one of the statements to be false, or did not believe it
to be true.

It is material to notice that the charge does not allege that
the statement made on the 23rd of January 1873 was known or
believed to be false, or not believed to be true. Nor does it
allege that the statement made on the 13th of February 1873
was known or believed to be false, or not believed to be true.
It merely alleges that one of the two statements set out in it
was known or believed to be false by the accused, or not believed

by him to be true.

Upon this charge he was tried, and in the summing-up of the
Judge, the jury were told, and very properly :—“ Before you
can find him guilty, you must be satisfied that he made one or
other of the statements contained in the charge knowing that
such statement was false, and deliberately intending to make a
false statement.” The majority of the jury found that the

“accused was guilty of the offence specified in the first and

second heads of charge, the offence specified being an offence
punishable under s, 193 of the Penal Code. After such a
summing-up, calling the attention of the jury so plainly to the
necessity of their being satisfied that one or other of the state-
ments was known to be false, and that the accused deliberately
intended to make a false statement, I think there can be no
doubt that the offence of giving false evidence within the mean-

==================================================
--- PAGE 32 (ROBUST CLEAN - PSM 3) ---

VOL. XIIL] - HIGH COURT.

ing of s, 191 of the Penal Code was committed on one or
other of the occasions specified in the charge. Then it appears
to me that the only question is, was it necessary, in order to
make the conviction legal, that the jury should find on which
of the two occasions the offence was committed? Does the law
in this country render that essential to a conviction for giving
false evidence ? |

The 439th section of the Code of Criminal Procedure now in
force requires that “ the charge shall state the offence with which
the accused person is charged,” and the 440th that “ the charge
shall contain such particulars as to the time and place of
the alleged offence and the person against whom it was committed
ag are reasonably sufficient to give notice té the accused person of
the matter with which he is charged.” The charge in this case
does that. Jt states what the offence is, namely, that the
accused committed an offence punishable under s. 193 of the
Penal Code, and it contains such particulars as to the time and
place as give sufficient notice to the accused of what he is
charged with. He is told that, by making the two statements,
one of which it is alleged he knew or believed to be false, or did
not believe to be true, he committed an offence punishable uader
8. 193.

S. 442 says that the charge may be in the form given in
the 3rd Schedule to the Act. In that Schedule there is such a
form of charge as was made against the accused in this case,
and it appears to me that, unless a conviction upon a charge so
framed is allowed by law to be valid, the putting this form of
charge in the Schedule was not only useless, but is also inconsist-
ent with saying that the jury is required by the law to find and to
state upon which of the two occasions mentioned in the charge
the false evidence was given. If the jury is required to state
that, then two charges in the form No. 10 in the Schedule would
‘be proper. One would state that evidence was given on the
23rd of January 1873, which the accused either knew or
‘believed to be false, and the other would state that evidence was
given on the 13th of February 1873; which the accused either
knew or believed to be false. If it is required by the law that
the jury or the Court, where the trial is with assessors, should

find distinctly on which of the occasions the false statement was
made, the alternative charge given in the Schedule is perfectly
useless. oe
Again, if it is necessary for the jury in ‘order that the convic-
tion shall be valid to say which of the two statements is the
false one, it is requiring the jury to find what is not alleged in
the charge. All that the charge alleges is that one of the state-
ments was known or believed to be false, or not believed to be
true, and that thereby the offence was committed. Such a
charge being authorized by the law, it appears to me that all
which the Court has to find to sustain a conviction for giving
false evidence is that the allegations in it are proved. .
In considering what the intention of the Legisiature was in
making these provisions in the new Code of Criminal Procedure,
and giving in the Schedule this form of charge, I think it is
important to see what, at the time this Act was passed, was the
acknowledged state of the law. It had been decided by a Full
Bench of this Court that. a conviction upon a charge of this

description was legal. That view of the law had been acted -

upon, undoubtedly, for some years in this presidency. In
Madras, as appears from the case of The Queen v. FPalany
Chetty (1), the same view of the law was adopted, and it cannot
be doubted that this decision was acted upon in that presidency.
We have no reported case in the Bombay High Court, and I do
not desire to speak merely from memory as to what was the
practice in that presidency. But in Madras and in Calcutta,
and my belief is in Bombay also, the law was con sidered at the
time this Act was passed to be that a conviction of a person who
was found to have intentionally made contradictory statements.
on oath or solemn affirmation was legal. I cannot think that
the ‘Legislature intended, by the way in which the new Code
has been drawn, by the omission of certain sections which are in
the old Code and the substitution of others, which probably were
supposed to. be an improvement in the wording or arrangement
of it, to alter the law as to the offence of giving false evidence.
That this charge, although called an alternative charge, and
being so far alternative that two statements are set out in it

VOL. XIIL] HIGH COURT.

when one offence ouly is alleged, namely, that the accused
thereby, that is by making statements one of which he knew. or
believed to be false, committed the offence, should be considered
as a charge of but one offence, and was to be dealt with by the
jury as such, I think is shown by s. 452, which says that there
shall be a separate charge for every offence. .

It was argued that it would prejudice the accused in respect
of his subsequently pleading an acquittal or a conviction if a
conviction were allowed upon a charge framed as this is, and
that he might be tried again for making one or other of. the
statements which are the subject of the present charge. S. 460
provides for a person who has once been tried for an offence, and
convicted or acquitted of such offence, not being liable to be
tried again on the same facta for the same offence, nor for any

other offence for which a different charge from the one made:

against him might have been made under s. 455, or for which
he might have been convicted under s. 456. If the question
should ever come before me, what is the effect of a conviction

or an acquittal upon such a charge as this, I should hold that

the accused could not be tried again for giving the evidence

on either occasion which is set out in the charge, for then he

would be tried again on at least a part of the same facts as he
had been tried upon before.

IT concur with my learned colleagues in thinking that the
second part of s. 461 does not apply to this case. This is a
charge of but one offence, and the conviction is a conviction of
that offence, and need not specify more than the offence of
which the person accused is convicted. Here the jury found
upon the facts proved before them that the accused committed
an offence punishable under s. 193. It appears to me that this
finding is a good finding; nor do I see that s. 257 as to the
duties of the jury interferes with it, or prevents the finding being
asitis, §. 257 says “ that it is the duty of the jury to decide
which view of the facts is true, and then to return the verdict
which under such view ought, according to the direction of the
_ Judge, to be returned.” I understand this to mean that it is the
duty of the jury to find whether the view of the facts that the
accused made the two statements, that they were such that they

could not both be true, and that he knew or believed one of them
to be false, is true. I do not understand it as meaning that the

Manomen jury have to select from a part of the charge some of the facts

and say whether they are true. What is meant is the whole view
of the facts alleged against the accused, the view taken by the
prosecution which leads to the conclusion of his guilt, or the
view which is set up on his behalf, and which would make him
innocent, I do not feel at all pressed by the provisions of
8. 257,
It appears to me that this was a charge authorized by the
law, and that the allegations in it which are sufficient to support .
a conviction have been found by the jury tobe proved. Ifit isa
good charge, nothing more is necessary to be found by the jury than
that the allegations contained ia it are true. I cannot say that
it is an illegal charge finding it, as I do, deliberately allowed by
the Legislature, and inserted in the Schedule which is referred
to in s, 442, |

I think therefore that the conviction is a good one.

I have to mention that two learned Judges, not now present,
Glover and Pontifex, JJ., are also of opinion that the conviction
is good.
